Goto https://codesandbox.io/ and create a react project
create a Button component inside App.js ( make sure your component is starting with a capital letter )
a component means a function
the text should be your <name> click me
apply a className on it, just add the corresponding class into the style.css file to give a background colour of Tomato, and give a padding 1rem to it

Problem
using a condition decide to decide how a component should render
{ condition ? ONTRUE : ONFALSE }
if rounded, then show a rounded avatar component
if not rounded show a normal rounded of 1rem for the image
add another prop, hideName, if hideName is true, then the name should not be shown
{ hideName ? <h1> </h1> : null}
